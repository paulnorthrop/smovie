\title{Sampling distribution of the correlation coefficient movie}
\usage{
corr_sim(n = 30, rho = 0, panel_plot = TRUE, hscale = NA,
  vscale = hscale, delta_n = 1, delta_rho = 0.1, pos = 1,
  envir = as.environment(pos))
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{An integer scalar.  The initial value of the sample size.
Must not be less than 2.}

\item{rho}{A numeric scalar.  The initial value of the true correlation
\eqn{\rho}.  Must be in [-1, 1].}

\item{panel_plot}{A logical parameter that determines whether the plot
is placed inside the panel (\code{TRUE}) or in the standard graphics
window (\code{FALSE}).  If the plot is to be placed inside the panel
then the tkrplot library is required.}

\item{hscale, vscale}{Numeric scalars.  Scaling parameters for the size
of the plot when \code{panel_plot = TRUE}. The default values are 1.4 on
Unix platforms and 2 on Windows platforms.}

\item{delta_n}{An integer scalar.  The amount by which the value of the
sample size is increased/decreased after one click of the +/- button.}

\item{delta_rho}{A numeric scalar.  The amount by which the value of
rho is increased/decreased after one click of the +/- button.}

\item{pos}{A numeric integer.  Used in calls to \code{\link{assign}}
to make information available across successive frames of a movie.
By default, uses the current environment.}

\item{envir}{An alternative way (to \code{pos}) of specifying the
environment. See \code{\link{environment}}.}

\description{
A movie to illustrate how the sampling distribution of the (Pearson
product moment) sample correlation coefficient \eqn{r} depends on the
sample size \eqn{n} and on the true correlation \eqn{\rho}.
}
\details{
Random samples of size \eqn{n} are simulated from a bivariate
  distribution with the property that the correlation between the two
  variables is equal to the value of chosen by the user.
  More specifically, the data are simulated from a
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution}{bivariate normal distribution}
  in which each of the variables has a mean of 0 and a variance of 1.

  The movie contains two plots.  On the top is a scatter plot of the
  simulated sample, illustrating the stength of the association between
  the simulated values of the variables.
  A new sample is produced by clicking the + button next to
  "simulate another sample:". [Ignore the - button.]
  For each simulated sample the sample correlation coefficient \eqn{r} is
  calculated and displayed in the title of the top plot.
  The values of these sample correlation coefficients are stored and
  are plotted in the histogram in the bottom plot.  As we accumulate
  a large number of values in this histogram the shape of the sampling
  distribution of \eqn{r} emerges.

  The values of the sample size \eqn{n} or true correlation coefficient
  \eqn{\rho} can be changed using the respective +/- buttons.
  If one of these is changed then the histogram in the bottom plot is
  reset using the sample correlation coefficient of the first sample
  simulated using the new combination of \eqn{n} and \eqn{\rho}.
