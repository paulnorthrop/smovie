Description: Provides movies to help students to understand statistical 
  concepts.  The 'rpanel' package  <https://cran.r-project.org/package=rpanel> 
  is used to create interactive plots that move to illustrate key statistical 
  ideas and methods.  There are movies to: visualise probability distributions
  (including user-supplied ones); illustrate sampling distributions of the
  sample mean (central limit theorem), the median, the sample maximum 
  (extremal types theorem) and (the Fisher transformation of the) 
  product moment correlation coefficient; examine the influence of an 
  individual observation in simple linear regression; illustrate key concepts 
  in statistical hypothesis testing. Also provided are dpqr functions for the 
  distribution of the Fisher transformation of the correlation coefficient 
  under sampling from a bivariate normal distribution.
